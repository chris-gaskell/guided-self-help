    "text": "Thank you for attending and welcome to the memory support skills group. This group has been designed for people who are experiencing difficulties with their memory. By participating in this group programme we hope that you will learn more about your difficulties and develop some strategies to help you manage these difficulties. The aims of the group are listed below:\nWe hope that the memory support skills group will also provide you with a space to share your experiences, knowledge and skills. It can be daunting coming together within a group and it’s perfectly natural to feel worried or anxious about attending and talking within a group. It is therefore important that we support one another and contribute as much or as little as we feel comfortable with. The emphasis of this group is active participation and it is equally important to contribute as much as you feel you can. It is also important that you attend all the sessions, however, if for some reason you can’t attend the group could you please let us know at least 24 hours in advance.\nThere will be the opportunity for you to complete some work out-of-session if you wish to. This is not compulsory, but may be helpful when thinking together about which strategies might help you manage your difficulties. Please also be aware that this group is not about ‘solving’ memory problems but developing strategies to help us to cope with our difficulties. It can take time to find the strategies that work for you, to implement these and for these to become effective. So it’s important that we take an explorative approach with trial and error.\nSometimes attending groups can cause us to have difficult thoughts and feelings. If you have any difficulties please feel able to arrange a time to discuss this with Grace Sunerton. I will endeavour to be available for telephone consultation on 01782 275188 to support you if you are having difficulties with the programme. There will also be space to ask any questions and explore with us your difficulties within the group if you feel comfortable sharing these."

We often talk about speed of information processing which refers to how quickly people are able to do this. For some people this may have slowed down which means that they find it hard to take new information in, especially when they’re trying to concentrate on lots of different things at once. Imagine that your mind works a bit like a computer.\n\nIf you have lots of programmes open at the same time this will put pressure on the computer and cause it to slow down. Equally, if you’re using one programme it might be overloaded with information. The same can happen with our minds, especially for people who have reduced speed of information processing. If you overload your mind, information might not go in properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are people with attention difficulties affected?\n\n\n\n\nIt takes me longer to answer questions now. If someone asks me something I have to stop and think about what it means before I can answer.\nI used to be able to do maths in my head really quickly but now it takes me ages.\nIf someone’s explaining what something means I have to ask them to slow down and repeat it because it takes a while for the information to sink in."

We also began to think about our own memory difficulties, when these started and any strategies we have tried to overcome them. Today, we’re going to focus in on memory.\nWhen we talk about ‘memory’ or we say ‘my memory’s getting really bad’, it’s easy to think of ‘memory’ as being one, singular function. However, in reality it’s much more complex.\nToday we’ll start off by looking at the memory process and linking it to the other cognitive abilities we have been introduced to. We’ll also be talking about what memory difficulties we have noticed ourselves, along with what aspects of memory we find work better for us. This can help us to identify where in the process our main difficulties are. In turn, we’re then able to come up with more effective and targeted strategies to support our memory.\nThe term memory is used to describe the process through which people acquire information through their senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell), store and recall that information. There are lots of different types of memory which require many thinking abilities. We will be talking about these later in the session.\nThe image below shows the different types of abilities:\n\n\n\nOur different senses impact our cognitive abilities."

    "text": "2.3 Memory and Mindfulness\nAs we’ve said before, if we’re distracted or trying to pay attention to lots of different things at once it can result in that information not going in properly.\nHave you ever arrived at a destination after a drive or a walk completely unaware of how you got there? This is what we call being on ‘automatic pilot’ and often happens because we’re so wrapped up in thoughts about the past and the future that we’re not paying attention to what’s happening around us in the present moment.\n\n\n\nStress has been shown to impact upon our abilitiy to remember..\n\n\n\nHow does this Impact on Our Memory?\nIf we’re paying attention to these thoughts about the past and the future it means that we’re not giving our full attention to what’s happening around us now. As we said before, this can impact on our memory because it means that important information might not be entering or being processed within our minds. We also end up using up our cognitive resources on this rather than learning new information.\n\n\nWhat is Mindfulness?\nMindfulness is about paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgementally. It is used to help people improve their wellbeing by helping people to defuse from these thoughts and improve their attention. By just noticing and paying attention to what’s happening now, mindfulness helps us to distance ourselves from our thoughts and be more present. Below are some of the core principles of mindfulness: - The ‘being’ mode: Mindfulness says that often we are so caught up in these thoughts about the past and future (the ‘doing’ mode) that we end up not paying attention to what’s happening around us now (the ‘being’ mode). - Self-compassion: We often have so much compassion and empathy for others that we forget to have the same for ourselves. Mindfulness is about extending some of this kindness to ourselves.\nMindfulness can have a positive impact on lots of areas of our lives including: - Emotional wellbeing: becoming more aware of our unhelpful thoughts and feelings and distancing ourselves from these. This can help us to realise that thoughts are just that thoughts! We will talk more about this in sessions 5 and 6. - Physical wellbeing: Becoming more aware of our bodies can be very useful for managing stress and reducing the release of cortisols. This is because we’re often not even aware of the impact of stress on our bodies. We will also discuss this in more detail in another session . - Cognitive functioning: Mindfulness can be used to help improve our attention. By becoming aware of our thoughts, feelings and physical sensations we can bring our attention back to the present moment and reduce how much time we spend in automatic pilot. This can actually also help us to train our attention and help us to process and encode information effectively."

The aim of this is just to help us be more present ‘in the moment’, and give us some time to become more aware of our thoughts, feelings and any physical sensations. As we’ll see later in the course, this can also support our cognitive functioning and help our memory along with promoting overall well-being.\nIf you have difficulty focusing on the breath (e.g. due to breathing difficulties) then go at a pace that feels comfortable to you, stop the meditation or focus on another part of your body, such as your feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Communicating my Difficulties to Others\n\n\n\nAs we said in the last session, having memory difficulties can impact on our lives in lots of different ways, including our relationships, work, mood and general wellbeing.\nA common problem for people with memory difficulties is thinking about whether and how we might tell other people about our difficulties. As a group, we will be thinking about the pros and cons of telling people about our memory difficulties and how this impacts on our lives.\nIf you want, you can use the table on the following page to jot down the pros and cons.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunicating out difficulties\n\n\n ## What are External Strategies?\nExternal strategies are used to help us compensate for difficulties with our memory. These strategies involve making external changes within our environment.\n\n\nIf you’re likely to remember things that you see, use pictures, drawings and photographs. These can help us to encode and store information into our memory as well as prompt our memory later on.\n\n\n\nPictures can help to elicit memories.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your memory is better for information that you hear it might be useful to use a Dictaphone to describe events of the day, record lectures or meetings or just to make a note of something important. This can also help us to encode and store information into our memory and that way if you forget you can listen back to the information to help to jog your memory. There is also computer software and audio versions of books which you can use to listen to information rather than relying on reading it.\n\n\n\nGetting organised at home is very important for memory. There are lots of different aids that can help us become more organised. If used consistently these aids can make life much easier and puts less strain on your memory. Below are some examples:\n\nFolders/files: Make folders and files for important papers, bills, recipes etc. so they’re easier to locate.\nSort it: everything should have its place. Sort drawers, cupboards, shelves etc.\nLabel it: use labels on drawers, doors, cabinets, files, boxes etc. That way you and others in your house will find it easier to locate and put things away.\nDiary/Filofax: using a diary or Filofax can be helpful for remembering what you need to do.\nCharts/calendars: Charts and calendars can also be useful for remembering what you need to do. Making these visible around the house is also useful because it helps us to pay attention to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nHanging boards, blackboards or bulletin boards can be helpful for remembering information. These can be strategically placed around the house for remembering information (e.g. in the hallway or on the fridge). You could use this for to do lists, shopping lists, for events or simply to jot down important information. ### Notes\nTake notes of what you need to remember but try to keep it in one place (i.e. a note pad) so you remember to look. You might want to keep a daily list of what need to remember. It’s important to write enough that you understand what you need to remember but not too much that it becomes overwhelming and counter-productive. We will demonstrate this later on.\n\n\n\nA journal can be useful for reflecting back on your day or checking what you did during the day later on if you’re unsure.\n\n\n\nLeave post it notes to remind you of things in places that you know you’ll look. For example, you might want to remind yourself to lock the door when you come in at night by putting a post it note next to the door.\n\n\n\nLeaving cues around the house or in other places can also help to jog your memory. For example, if you leave your notebook by the kettle you might be more likely to pick it up in the morning.\n\n\n\nIt might be worth creating a daily ‘to do’ list of things you need to do. You can add to this throughout the day and tick off when each task has been completed.\n ### Environment\nTry to eliminate background noise as much as possible to reduce distraction. Turn off the TV or radio and close doors if people are talking. Getting rid of clutter can help to reduce visual distraction. This will help you to have more focused rather than divided attention.\n\n\n\nWith technology continuously changing, new memory aids are constantly developing. Below are some examples of these:\n\nLocation detection devices: These can be useful if you if you misplace/forget where important things are. They can be attached to keys or other important devices and make a loud sound to help you find it. Mobile phones can also be linked to family and friends so they know your whereabouts if you’re worried getting lost\nTablets/computers: Also have similar functions to smart phones but are slightly bigger. You can ‘sync’ your devices (share your information and apps between your phone/computer/tablet). This can be useful if other people need access to your information or you use more than one device for different things (e.g. at work, home or when you’re out).\nSatellite Navigation (SATNAV): Can be used if you have difficulty remembering routes. Navigation systems are also available on phones and tablets.\nPhones: Phones have a number of useful features including calendars, alarms and reminders. Smart phones have a number of additional apps and features that can be helpful for remembering information. This includes budgeting tools and notes pages for writing lists. Some phones even have ‘memory aid apps’ which incorporate lots of different strategies to help your memory.\n\n\n\n\nWhen learning something new you should try to pace yourself and start off with simple tasks, gradually increasing their difficulty and length of time spent on the task. This will also help to gradually train your attention.\n\n\n\nAre you a morning person or do you function better later in the day? Try to schedule activities which put higher demands on your attention and memory for the time of day when you perform the best.\n\n\n\nWhen doing new things or tasks that you know will put high demands on you plan ahead and take your time. For example, if people are talking too quickly or if you don’t understand something ask them to slow down or repeat the information.\n\n\n\nEnsure that you take regular breaks when learning something new. This will help to take the pressure off your concentration and minimise tiredness and frustration caused by overexerting yourself. It’s also useful to give yourself rewards to look forward to.\n\n\n\nMaintaining a good routine is very important for memory. This is because when something becomes part of our routine it put less pressure on our memory and becomes part of our procedural memory (our long term memory of how to perform different actions or skills). These types of memories are so ingrained they usually become automatic which is why they put less pressure on other types of memory or our attention.\n\n\n\nSometimes it’s easier to retrieve information if we’re in the same place, situation or mood we were in when we learned that information. If you’re having trouble remembering something it might be worth going back to the place or situation you encoded it.\n\n\n\nIt’s useful to start off by making a plan of which strategies would be useful for you and when you aim to start implementing each strategy. Try to focus on one strategy at a time. Remember that it takes time for strategies work and become part of our routine so try to be patient and stick with the strategies even if you feel they’re not working straight away."

    "text": "3.2 How do I Know which Strategies will be the Most Useful for Me?\nWhen deciding which strategies are the most useful for you, ask yourself questions about what exactly the problem is.\n\nDo I have a specific difficulty with my memory?\nThink about whether there’s a specific difficulty with your memory. For example, is it that you’re forgetting what you need to do? Are you forgetting names? Are you having difficulty recognising faces? Then focus your strategies on these difficulties.\n\n\nDo I remember information better when I see or hear things?\nIf you’re better at remembering visual information, try to incorporate as many visual aids into your plan such as pictures, diagrams or photos. If you’re better at remembering verbal information use verbal aids such as saying things out loud or using a Dictaphone.\n\n\nDo I forget things shortly after they’ve happened or after an extended period of time?\nIf you’re likely to forget things straight away, use the strategies immediately. E.g. put things in your diary straight away, write your lists straight away etc. If you’re likely to forget things over an extended period of time think ahead! Take photos, write things down important information etc.\n\n\nAre you having a specific difficulty during the process of learning?\nThink about the process of learning new information (see session 2) and try to identify where you’re having difficulty. Is it that you’re getting distracted and not paying attention? Do you feel as though you’ve slowed down a bit? Are you having trouble encoding, storing or retrieving the information? Try to focus your strategies on the different stages of this process. For example, if you’re having difficulty with your attention try to focus on one task at a time, clear external clutter and take regular breaks. See the table below for more information on this."

Give yourself time to adjust!\nDon’t try to do too much at once. When implementing new strategies try to do one at a time. That way you’re more likely to remember and incorporate it into your routine.\nKeep track of your progress. Keep a diary of all the strategies you’re implementing and monitor your progress over a month or a week. That way you can also review whether those strategies are working for you.\n\n\n\nHow can I effectively utilise external memory aids?\nIt’s important that we use our memory aids effectively in order for them to work. There are some examples of effective and ineffective use of strategies on the next couple of pages. Here are some tips for utilising external memory enhancement strategies effectively:\n\nKeep it simple. Focus on the main bits that you need to remember.\nDon’t write too much or too little. It’s important to write just enough to help jog your memory later on.\nDon’t overload your mind with visual and verbal information because when you read over it will be too overwhelming for your mind to take it in and visualise later on.\nUse visual and verbal aids wherever possible to aid memory.\nOrganise your notes on the page so it’s easy to visualise later on."

    "text": "4.3 Internal Strategies\nAs we’ve said, internal memory enhancement strategies are strategies that we use within our minds to aid memory. An outline of some of these strategies is provided below.\n\nChunking of Information\nRather than trying to remember a whole phone number or list such as 1485968704, chunk the numbers into 148-596-8704.\n\n\n\nRepetition\nWhen trying to encode information into you memory, rehearse it.\nYou can do this by either repeating it out loud or in your head.\n\n\nGrouping\nGrouping information together into categories can aid recall because it makes information more meaningful. For example, if you need to remember a shopping list it might be useful to group items into fruits, vegetables etc.\n\n\nBreaking down tasks\nWhen learning how to do something new it can be helpful to plan and break the task down into smaller steps. Write these steps down so you can refer back to them next time you do that task. For example, if learning how to cook a new dish you might break down the task into smaller sections; write a checklist of all the ingredients I need, write a list of all the utensils I need, take out the ingredients, take out the utensils, turn on the oven etc. This will help you to attend to each aspect of the task and consolidate learning.\n\n\nThe PQRST method\nThe PQRST method is used to help improve our memory for information that we read. Reading is usually quite a passive way of learning but PQRST helps us to remember better by making the process more active. Each letter stands for a different stage in this process:\n\nP stands for PREVIEW: You should preview the text that you are going to read by quickly skimming through it. This will help you to get an idea of what the text is about.\nQ stands for QUESTION: Next you should ask yourself questions about the text. E.g What is it about? Who are the main characters? What am I supposed to learn from this? You can write these down if needed.\nR stands for READ: Read the text, keeping the questions you asked yourself in mind. This will help you focus on the most important areas.\n\nS stands for SUMMARY: Summarise the key points of the text. Ask yourself what was it about? Did it make sense to you? Do I need to reread anything?\nT stands for TEST: Test your knowledge of it, you can do this by asking yourself the questions you thought of earlier and see if you’re better able to answer them now. This will help you to consolidate the information.\n\n\n\nMaking Associations\nMaking associations between something you need to remember and previous knowledge can help us to make the new information more meaningful and we therefore remember it better. This includes:\n\nRemembering to do a new activity by linking it to an existing one. For example, taking medication at meal times\nLearning a new name by associating it with something or someone you already know. For example, you might remember the name Angela by thinking of an angel.\nLeaving an item associated with an activity visible so you remember to do it. E.g. leaving the boots by the door so you remember to take the dog for a walk.\n\n\n\n\nMental Retracing\nIf we’re struggling to remember something, retracing our movements, activities and thoughts in our heads can be helpful.\n\n\nStories\nMaking up stories can be useful for remembering things. For example, if you had a shopping list of weetabix, milk, jam, teabags and toothpaste you might create a story like ‘In the morning I get up and have my Weetabix with milk and jam then I have a nice cup of tea before I brush my teeth’.\n\n\nVisual Imagery\nThe use of visual imagery can be very helpful for learning and remembering information. Below are some examples:\n\nThings to do - If you need to complete a task like posting a letter, you can imagine yourself doing that task. By making the association between the post-box and the action of posting the letter you’re more likely to remember to do it.\nRoutes – If you need to remember a new route it can be useful imagining yourself walking the route.\nPeg Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeg Method\n\n\n\nThis method uses two memory strategies to help you remember information. It uses ‘association’ and ‘visualisation’. The idea is that you will ‘hang’ one piece of information on each peg.\nFollowing the steps below to set up your pegs:\n\nNumber your pegs in order, e.g. 1 2 3 4\nWrite down a word that rhymes with each number. This works best if the word can be easily pictured in your mind, e.g. two = shoe\n\n………………………………………………………………………..\n………………………………………………………………………..\n………………………………………………………………………..\n………………………………………………………………………..\n\nWhat does each word look like as a picture in your mind, e.g. is it cartoon, is it colour, how big is it? Can you draw this in the box?\nRepeat the paired numbers/words aloud until you feel confident with them\nRepeat the paired numbers/words in your head and as you do this, visualise the words as pictures in your mind\nImagine you need to remember to phone a friend later today. Use your imagination to associate a visual image of phoning a friend, with the visual image of peg one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of Session Work\n\n\n\nImplementing my External Memory Enhancement Strategy\nBetween now and the next session we would like you to start implementing the strategy that you have chosen. It’s important to remember that it takes time for strategies to start working so we should try not to have expectations about the effectiveness of the strategy."

    "section": "5.3 How our Thoughts and Mood Affect Memory",
    "text": "5.3 How our Thoughts and Mood Affect Memory\nThroughout the sessions we have mentioned how mood is important when looking at memory difficulties. The problems experienced may have an impact on how you think and feel. For example you may notice you are having a problem remembering something. This in turn causes you to have thoughts like “I’m so stupid” which can then make you feel low in mood.\n\nThe way in which you think can influence the way you feel (emotionally and physically) which can then have an impact on your behaviour. The diagram below shows how all these are linked together in a “cycle”.\n\n\nHow this can impact memory?\nSo, why have we explored these ‘cycles’? What impact might they have on our cognitive functioning, including our memory? Getting caught up in a cycle of unhelpful thoughts-feelings-physical sensations-behaviour can affect these functions in several different ways:\n\nThoughts: Being very critical of ourselves and our memory difficulties can increase stress levels. It can also mean we become more aware of times when we have difficulty with our memory and ignore any times when our memory is fine. Different kinds of unhelpful thoughts are outlined later.\n\nDistraction – When we are focusing on worrying thoughts (known as ruminating) we divert our cognitive resources to our worries and stresses. This not only impacts on processing of new information but also means that we’re not paying attention to other things and we consequently do not process this new information.\n\nPhysiological changes – As we mentioned before, the body releases hormones in reaction to stress (cortisol in reaction to low level stress and adrenaline in reaction to high level stress). This release of cortisol can result in new information not being processed properly and difficulty retrieving information we have encoded and stored.\n\nSleep and fatigue – When we’re feeling worried or stressed this can impact on our sleep and result in feeling tired and fatigued throughout the day. This can in turn impact on our ability to concentrate and retrieve stored information. We also consolidate new information into our memory during sleep so if we are not sleeping properly this could impact on encoding of new information into our memories.\n\n\nBehaviour - If we feel stressed or low in mood, sometimes we feel like doing less. We may stop engaging in activities we usually find enjoyable, or not feel like being around other people. However, doing less means we don’t get as much cognitive stimulation, which means we don’t get chance to use our memory skills. Social withdrawal can also play a part in maintaining low mood and anxiety"

Whilst all these thoughts and reactions are normal, they can cause us distress. Take some time to consider your own experiences.\nWhat impact have memory difficulties had on your mood, if any? What thoughts have you had about yourself as a result of memory difficulties? Does this in turn have an impact on how serious you perceive your memory difficulties to be?

This can have a positive impact on how we feel and what we do. As we’ve discussed, this can also support our cognitive functioning and memory.\n\nSo how do we go about changing these?

Mindfulness is quite tricky to explain because it’s something we learn through experience over time. It is usually taught and practiced through meditation but we can be mindful in anything we do like walking, eating and even cleaning.\nMindfulness is about noticing and observing our thoughts but not getting caught up in them then switching our attention to something else like our breathing or other tasks at hand.

    "text": "5.8 ‘Getting present’\n(This section is taken from the book ‘Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world’ by Mark Williams and Danny Penman)\nLike we said, often in life we can find ourselves on ‘automatic pilot’; become lost in our own thoughts; or get so distracted and carried away with tasks and things to do, that we forget about what we had set out to do in the first place. For example, has it ever happened to you, that you go into a room to get something but by the time you reach the door you’ve forgotten what it was? As we’ve mentioned, all this can make it very hard for our brains to keep up, paying attention, taking information in, processing it and storing it.\nAs we’ve seen, mindfulness is a way of connecting to the present moment, of simply ‘being’ and noticing (purposefully, and non-judgementally) all of our body sensations and experiences. Over time, some people find that this provides them with a whole new perspective and way of living – however mindfulness techniques can also be used as a helpful strategy for choosing and learning to control our focus of attention. If we think of our minds like a computer with several programs running all at once, mindfulness can be a good way of closing down some of the many ‘tabs’ we have open (freeing up space and avoiding ‘unexpected errors’). We can develop flexibility in our attention and contact with the present, by bringing our awareness to everyday activities, so that we can see life as it is, unfolding moment by moment (it sounds simple, but does require practice).\nThere are lots of activities that we usually do without thinking which we can do more ‘mindfully’ by paying full attention to it. This includes:\n\nBrushing your teeth\nWalking from one room to another at home or work\nDrinking tea, coffee or juice\nTaking out the rubbish\nLoading the washing machine or doing the dishes\n\nNoticing your unhelpful thoughts can take some practice. Over the next week, keep an eye out and notice any occasions when you experience an unhelpful thought about memory.\nRemember, we all experience these kinds of thoughts at times; try not to be hard on yourself if you do notice any. Instead, think about trying one of the strategies that we have discussed. See what impact this has on how you feel.\nTo help you keep a track, to use the table on the following page."

It’s also a chance to reflect on how we can apply the skills developed in the future. During the programme we have discussed the impact of mood on cognitive functioning, and in turn the impact our cognitive functioning can have on our mood. During session 5 we identified the links between our thoughts-feelings-body sensations-behaviour. We identified some ‘unhelpful thoughts’ about our memory and ourselves, and thought about how to challenge these. We also had an introduction to the benefits of mindfulness. Both of these skills can help us to maintain good mental health and wellbeing. This is important for our cognitive functioning generally and memory in particular. It’s also really important to consider how we can maintain good physical and emotional health – our general well-being. This is because our cognitive functions do not operate in isolation: they are impacted by our physical health. For example, our heart and blood vessels carry important oxygen and nutrients to brain cells, vital for efficient cognitive functioning. During today’s session we will think about what we can do to promote our physical and emotional well-being."

Our minds often wander and life is sometimes filled with stresses or worries. To start off today, and at the beginning of our future sessions, we will carry out a brief breathing exercise. The aim of this is just to help us be more present ‘in the moment’, and give us some time to become more aware of our thoughts, feelings and any physical sensations. As we’ll see later in the course, this can also support our cognitive functioning and help our memory along with promoting overall well-being.

The plate below shows a healthy balanced diet, which helps to keep cholesterol and blood pressure low. It can also support our cognitive functioning.\nThere has been lots of research into what particular food groups or nutrients may support cognitive functions and memory. There are also certain foods that can help promote a healthy brain such as Omega 3 fatty acid (nuts, seeds, olive oils and oily fish) and antioxidants (broccoli, blueberries and spinach). There is some evidence that B vitamins, especially B12, may also support memory functioning as we get older.

Research shows that several cardiovascular risk factors (including obesity and high blood pressure) are also risk factors for cognitive decline, so exercise can aid both physical and cognitive well-being.\nExercise also improves the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain, helping us to perform better mentally. It boosts the release of endorphins, or so-called ‘feel good’ hormones; and lots of research suggests that it can have a good impact on our emotional well-being and symptoms of stress, anxiety or low mood.\nCurrent guidelines recommend that adults take part in moderate exercise for the equivalent of 30 minutes, 5 days a week (or 75 minutes of more vigorous exercise spread across the week). Moderate exercise means doing something that raises your heartbeat, but that you can do whilst holding a conversation.\nExamples include going for a brisk walk or pushing the lawnmower, so it may be easier than we sometimes think to incorporate exercise into our daily routine. For example, getting off the bus a stop early or walking to the shop rather than driving all count. Like all skills, it will take some time to notice the benefits that exercise brings, but keeping going on a regular basis will maximise those benefits."

For example, keeping active and doing the things we enjoy has multiple benefits: it ensures we get a good amount of cognitive stimulation; it provides opportunity to use our cognitive abilities; and chance to practice strategies to support memory; and it also improves mood.\nJust as we devote time to ensuring our physical health is as good as it can be, we can take some time to look after our emotional well-being too. As we discussed last session, how we feel can have a positive impact on our cognitive functioning and memory.\nLooking after our emotional and mental well-being may involve doing things that help us to relax, take time out and feel good about ourselves. These needn’t be big things; some examples could be:\n\nDoing a relaxation exercise\nReading a book\nHaving a long shower or bath\nHaving a nice meal, and really taking time to enjoy it\nWalking and playing with a pet\nPhoning a friend or going out for a catch up\nPainting, making a collage, knitting, writing or drawing – anything you find soothing\n\nRegularly practicing a mindfulness relaxation exercise, like those we have introduced during the programme, can also support our general well-being. If this is something that interests you, you can listen to CD of some mindfulness relaxation exercises. Listening to these and deciding which work best for you, along with practicing frequently, can help you to gain the benefits of these exercises. As we’ve discussed, these exercises can also help us to become more aware of our thoughts, feelings and physical sensations and become more aware of where we focus our attention.\nA key point is taking a holistic approach – our cognitive functioning is impacted by other parts of our well-being, so looking after all and making small changes in one area can have a positive impact on others.\nIf it is difficult to make time for these activities, making a plan might help. Some people find it useful to plan time in the diary or calendar for them, as you would other appointments and meetings. For others the Toolbox approach might be helpful (Adapted from www.getselfhelp.co.uk)."

Discussing our memory difficulties.\n\n\nSession 4\nInternal memory enhancement strategies – drawing our inner resources to support memory\n\n\nSession 5\nMood and cognitive functioning\n\n\nSession 6\nGeneral well-being and cognitive functioning – physical and emotional health\n\n\n\nThere’s been a lot to take in. As we discussed at the start of the course, different bits of information and skills will feel most useful and relevant to different people. When it comes to memory enhancement strategies, a bit of a ‘trial and error’ approach can help us to try out different skills and work out what works best for us.\nAt this point it can be really helpful to plan how we might take forward and develop the skills and information discussed during the programme. Just like a toolbox, we can now put together our strategies or ‘tools’ to help support our memory.\n\nPrepare:\nDecide what you are going to do, when, how and who with. Set time aside each day, perhaps in the evening, to plan the next day. Be realistic in what you hope to achieve – don’t put too much pressure on yourself.\n\n\nList:\nPrioritise what would be the most important, most urgent, most helpful, most effective thing to do. Write it down (use a weekly planner, a diary or notepad).\nTry to make goals SMART (specific; measurable; attractive; realistic; time-bound)\n\n\nAction:\nDo it! Put your plan into action.\n\n\nNotice:\nNotice how the activity affects you. If it was unhelpful, then ask yourself if you could have done anything differently, or maybe decide not to do it again. If it has a helpful or positive effect, then plan to do more. What else could you do?"
