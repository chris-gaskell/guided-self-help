# Introduction {-}

Thank you for attending and welcome to the memory support skills group.
This group has been designed for people who are experiencing
difficulties with their memory. By participating in this group programme
we hope that you will learn more about your difficulties and develop
some strategies to help you manage these difficulties. The aims of the
group are listed below:

-   To develop knowledge and understanding of our memory and the process
    underpinning it.

-   To develop awareness of and share our own difficulties.

-   To develop internal and external strategies to support our memory.

-   To increase knowledge and understanding of the impact of memory
    difficulties on our well-being.

-   To develop an awareness of strategies to support psychological and
    emotional well-being.

-   To increase our knowledge and understanding of cognitive functioning
    and abilities

We hope that the memory support skills group will also provide you with
a space to share your experiences, knowledge and skills. It can be
daunting coming together within a group and it's perfectly natural to
feel worried or anxious about attending and talking within a group. It
is therefore important that we support one another and contribute as
much or as little as we feel comfortable with. The emphasis of this
group is active participation and it is equally important to contribute
as much as you feel you can. It is also important that you attend all
the sessions, however, if for some reason you can't attend the group
could you please let us know at least 24 hours in advance.

There will be the opportunity for you to complete some work
out-of-session if you wish to. This is not compulsory, but may be
helpful when thinking together about which strategies might help you
manage your difficulties. Please also be aware that this group is not
about 'solving' memory problems but developing strategies to help us to
cope with our difficulties. It can take time to find the strategies that
work for you, to implement these and for these to become effective. So
it's important that we take an explorative approach with trial and
error.

Sometimes attending groups can cause us to have difficult thoughts and
feelings. If you have any difficulties please feel able to arrange a
time to discuss this with Grace Sunerton. I will endeavour to be
available for telephone consultation on 01782 275188 to support you if
you are having difficulties with the programme. There will also be space
to ask any questions and explore with us your difficulties within the
group if you feel comfortable sharing these.

## Group Rules

As we mentioned, we hope that members of the group will support and learn from each other. We also hope all the members will share thoughts, ideas and experiences during the sessions.  However, it can help to have a few ‘ground rules’ to ensure that everyone feels as comfortable as possible and to help the group run smoothly.  
This can also help to ensure that everyone has chance to contribute to the group.  Is there anything that you would suggest could help the group to run smoothly? Feel free to make a note of any group rules agreed upon in the space below.
